I am a graduate student focusing on data analytics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in both the technical and social aspects of analytics and enjoy working with data. Before starting my masters program, I worked as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst/Data Engineer at a startup in Boulder, CO called Trada.

When I am not thinking about data, I am day dreaming about exotic places that I want to travel to. The background music in my life is most likely to be made by Bonobo. My favorite color is purple (I know :-) ).
