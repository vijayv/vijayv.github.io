I am a graduate student focusing on **data analytics** at the **University of California, Berkeley**. I love answering questions with data whether it is through **visualization and exploration**, **machine learning**, or simply figuring out a strategy to **scraping and cleansing** data that is difficult to find.

During the summer of 2015, I will be interning at Facebook as a Data Engineer. Before starting my masters program, I was a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst/Data Engineer at a startup in Boulder, CO called [Trada](http://www.trada.com).

When I am not thinking about data, I am day dreaming about exotic places that I want to travel to, hiking, or playing soccer with friends. My favorite color is <span style="color:purple">purple</span> and my favorite musician is [Bonobo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=kdj7RlPPQfg).
