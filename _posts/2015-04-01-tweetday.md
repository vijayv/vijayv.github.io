On Twitter, individuals and outlets frequently use the acronym ICYMI to bring links to the attention of others who may not have seen them. ICYMI stands for In Case You Missed It (see figure 1.). The New York Times even has a section at the bottom of its application called “In Case You Missed It” with articles from previous days. On Twitter, it is easy to miss out on information just because you did not check in throughout the day. To a lot of people this 'missing out' and the associated experience of exclusion can be agonizing. Even if you do have time at the end of the day to check your Twitter timeline, the manner in which the tweets are presented to you makes it cognitively difficult and time consuming to identify what was happening in moments throughout the day.

> We aim to create a visualization that will allow a user to see a day’s worth of information from tweets by the people they follow on Twitter.

*Figure 1.2: Upon logging in the user is presented a screen divided into two main fields. The SeeSoft-esque view is on the left and the treemap is on the right.*

The SeeSoft field displays a line per tweet, the length of the line proportional to the number of characters in each tweet. The line is centered on the middle, creating a mirroring effect. The opposites sides of the line are colored by the number of favorites or retweets of that tweet. The brightness of the color indicates a greater proportional number of favorites or retweets (white being the most). There is an added benefit in displaying both metrics in the same space as sometimes a tweet with have far more favorites than retweets (or the reverse) and that would be quickly signaled to the user in our design. The color disappears as approaching the center with a linear gradient. Hovering over a line brings up a tooltip showing the contents of the tweet and highlights the line (see figure 24). Scrolling through the lines with the j and k keys moves up and down from the latest line viewed and presents a tooltip showing the tweet (see figure 25).

To the left of the lines are blue curves linking together a tweet that is a reply to the tweet to which it is in reply. Hovering over a curve brings up a tooltip showing the two tweets and highlights the lines representing those tweets.

*Figure 1.3: Hovering over a curve displays the pair of tweets - reply and replied to.*

To the right of the lines is a brush tool that allows the user to change the selection of tweets. It initially loads at the fullest extent. Changing the selection updates the tweets visible in the treemap.

*Figure 1.4: Note the brush tool used to reduce the tweets visible in the treemap.*

The treemap field displays the tweets in boxes. The sizes of the boxes are determined by the number of favorites or retweets for that tweet (the metric can be toggled at the top). If the tweet has a media attached (a picture or video), the media is displayed in place of any text. If the media is a video it can be played from within the treemap by right-clicking on the image. Hovering over a box brings up a tooltip showing the contents of the tweet and highlights the line representing that tweet in the SeeSoft field. This highlighting grants the user the benefit of seeing the larger context within which that tweet was made. As noted above, the brush links with the treemap to update the field of available tweets represented. A user can also select to only see pictures or only see images in the treemap.

*Figure 1.5: The image is hovered over, bringing up the tooltip displaying the image and name of the account making the tweet, the full text of the tweet along with a larger view of the image, and the number of favorites and retweets while the location of the tweet is highlighted in blue in the left field.*
