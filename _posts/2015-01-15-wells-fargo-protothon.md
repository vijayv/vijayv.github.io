title: Wells Fargo Protothon
---

Wells Fargo reached out to Stanford and Berkeley students to help them better position their products for millennials. After exhausting countless Post-It notes and at least two poster boards, we got the happy news: First Place! In fact, UC Berkeley School of Information swept the event by claiming both the first and second prizes!

We got some nice press as well:

* [Millennials Create Remedies for Improving Their Financial Health](http://stories.wellsfargobank.com/millennials-create-remedies-improving-financial-health/?cid=facebook)
* [I School](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/news/20141208wellsfargoprotothon)

## The Process

The selection for the competition was based the answer to the question: 

> What does financial health mean to the millennial generation?

Those who were accepted to the competition were invited to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco where we formed teams of 4-5 to try to come up with tangible and realistic recommendations to present to senior Wells Fargo executives, including CDO Charles Thomas.

I can't say much about our idea given all the legal documents that we signed, however, I can say that it was extremely fun to work with such a diverse set of people on making it work. Our team worked well together and was able to put forth a cohesive solution despite the many different ideas that we initially started with.
