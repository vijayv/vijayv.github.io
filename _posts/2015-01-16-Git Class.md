At UC Berkeley I School, we use Git and Github for source control and collaboration in almost all of the courses. However, many of my classmates are encountering both of these tools for the first time. Given my extensive, and, often times, frustrating, experience with Git and Github from my time at Trada, I decided to do what I Schoolers do and share my knowledge. I held a training session for about 10 students and it turned out to be a good experience for everyone. While I didn't get to cover all of the material that I had prepared, I was happy to answer some questions which helped address some of the confounding factors of Git and Github. By popular demand, there will be a follow-up class where I will cover more advanced material but, until then, here is the syllabus as it was covered in the first class.
