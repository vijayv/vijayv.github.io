At the [I School](http://ischool.berkeley.edu), we use Git and Github for source control and collaboration in almost all of the courses. However, many of my classmates are encountering both of these tools for the first time. Given my extensive, and, often times, frustrating, experience with Git and Github from my time at Trada, I decided share my knowledge. I held a training session for about 10 students and it turned out to be a good experience for everyone. The material that we covered in class is below and I plan on cleaning it up and making it an accessible lesson of the future students.
