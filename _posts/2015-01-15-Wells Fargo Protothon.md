Leaving a job and company that I loved to come to grad school was an incredibly difficult decision; in fact, it was so difficult, I lingered on it for several years! Part of the appeal of grad school is that it allows for time and opportunities that may not be available while working full time. I wanted to take full advantage of this fact during my time at Berkeley.

Wells Fargo reached out to Stanford and Berkeley students to help them better position their products for millennials. The selection process for the competition was based the answer to the question "what does financial health mean to the millennial generation?". Those who were accepted to the competition were invited to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco where we formed teams of 4-5 to try to come up with tangible and realistic recommendations to present to senior Wells Fargo executives, including CDO Charles Thomas.

I can't say much about our idea given that it is proprietary information, however, it was extremely fun to work with such a diverse set of people to bring it all together. My team worked well together and was able to put forth a cohesive solution despite the many different ideas that we initially started with. After exhausting countless post it notes and at least two poster boards, we got the happy news: First Place! In fact, UC Berkeley School of Information swept the event by claiming both the first and second prizes!

We got some nice press as well:
