For my masters project, I worked with a team of five people to create an automatic, extensible, question generation service. Why would I want to automatically generate questions from text, you ask? 

## The Problem

Well, imagine the following scenario:

> A user sees a provocative news headline
>
> <img alt="Provocative News Headline" class="materialboxed" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/optimized/the-gadfly-project-headline.png" width="400"/>
>
> Instead of reading the article, the user decides to comment right away
>
> <img alt="Dumb Comment" class="materialboxed" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/optimized/the-gadfly-project-comment.png" width="400"/>
>
> The comment doesn't add to the discussion and creates a thread of unrelated replies

## A Solution, Perhaps?

So, what if we intervened at the right moment, with a simple question based on the article? A question that Nikhil would be able to answer easily if he had read the article?

> The user is prompted to answer a question that is based on the article
>
> <img alt="Question Intervention" class="materialboxed" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/optimized/the-gadfly-project-question.png" width="400"/>

Paternalistic, you say?

Perhaps, but, less so than removing comment sections altogether [as many publications have done](http://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/08/17/489516952/npr-website-to-get-rid-of-comments).

## This sounds great/terrible, where can I find out more?

You can try our demo at [gadflyproject.com](http://gadflyproject.com) for the time being.

Our extensive report that includes all of our amazing research can be found [here](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2016/gadfly_project).

All of our code is on [Github](https://github.com/TheGadflyProject).

The best part about working on this project was the chance to work with my wonderful teammates, Andy Huang, Nikhil Mane, Daniel Griffin, and Anand Rajagopal.
